# Git Commit Rules

When generating Git commit messages, use this format:

<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>

Rules:
- The first line is the commit title.
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added").
- Keep the title â‰¤ 72 characters.
- Valid types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore.
- Scope is optional.
- The body briefly explains what and why.
